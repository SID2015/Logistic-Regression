# Logistic-Regression on two different dataset

In this ML algorithm, we will perform logistic regression on two different dataset

#Part 1

   We will build a logistic regression model to
predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.
                Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department 
and you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their
results on two exams. You have historical data from previous applicants
that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training
example, we have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions
decision.

# Part 2
   
   In the second part of our task,we will implement regularized logistic regression
to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assur-
ance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure
it is functioning correctly.
Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the
test results for some microchips on two different tests. From these two tests,
you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or
rejected. To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results
on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model
